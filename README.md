# Traffic Sign Recognition

This is a simple Traffic Sign Recognition project done using Keras with Tensorflow backend on the Belgium Traffic Sign Dataset.

The dataset can be found here: http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/

It makes use of Convolutional Neural Networks. With 50 epochs, about 99.5% accuracy can be observed. 

A pretrained model (Ran only 7 epochs giving an accuracy of about 97%) is also included in the repository.
